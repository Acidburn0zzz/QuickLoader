QuickLoader

This is a sample app to demonstrate how to implement an app as candidate for "Power Button Actions"
in NamelessRom.

Power Button Actions allow the user to choose a custom action, when he/she/it presses
"Power + Volume up" or "Power + Volume down"

In our example (QuickLoader) we will start an activity, which displays an dialog, to enter an URL
and optionally a file name and download the file to the device.

Usecase
---

You are browsing the internet with your favourite browser, eg [Chrome Beta][1] and see a
funny cat video.
The video opens in a new tab but there is no option to download.

Now QuickLoader aids you! Just copy the URL, press "Power + Volume down / up", paste the URL and
press "Download".

Really easy and open sourcy, right?

Implementation
---

- You need to add the following permission to your manifest

```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.LAUNCH_WITH_POWER_CHORD" />
```

- Then you will need to add the following intent filter to your activity

```xml
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.ACTION_POWER_CHORD" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    </intent-filter>
```
